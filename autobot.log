==> Caveats
For ddclient to work, you will need to create a configuration file
in /home/monday/.linuxbrew/etc/ddclient, a sample configuration can be found in
/home/monday/.linuxbrew/opt/ddclient/share/doc/ddclient.

Note: don't enable daemon mode in the configuration file; see
additional information below.

The next reboot of the system will automatically start ddclient.

You can adjust the execution interval by changing the value of
StartInterval (in seconds) in /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.ddclient.plist,
and then
