==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall ant@1.9`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/monday/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/monday/.linuxbrew/opt/ant@1.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
